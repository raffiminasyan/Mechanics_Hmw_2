First case Masses:
M1 = 5 kg
M2 = 10 kg
M3 = 15 kg
Initial Velocities:
u1 = u2 = u3 = 0 m/s (equal initial velocities)
Rope Length (L): 10 meters
Time Step (dt): 0.01 seconds
In this situation, when we had different masses for M1, M2, and M3 but they all started with the same speed of 0 meters per second, 
we noticed that they moved in a steady, straight line without speeding up or slowing down. Each body moved predictably without any changes in its motion.
Also, the maximal distance D that M1 moved from its original position was determined to be 0.0 meters.

Second Case Masses
M1 = 3  kg
M2 = 8 kg
M3 = 12 kg
Initial Velocities:
u1 = 2 u2 = 0   u3= -1 m/s 
Rope Length (L): 8 meters
Time Step (dt): 0.05 seconds

In this situation we have three bodies with different masses and initial velocities. where M1 is the lightest, 
M3 is the heaviest, and M2 is in between. The initial velocities are unequal, with M1 moving faster, M3 moving slower,
and M2 initially at rest. Also, the maximal distance D that M1 moved from its original position was determined to be 0.09869565217391305 meters.


*Third Case
Second Case Masses
M1 = 5  kg
M2 = 5 kg
M3 = 5 kg
Initial Velocities:
u1 = 0.5 u2 = 0.5   u3= 0.5 m/s (equal initial velocities)
Rope Length (L): 10 meters
Time Step (dt): 0.1 seconds
In this scenario, all three objects have the same mass of 5 kg each, 
and they begin with identical velocities of 0.5 m/s. The rope connecting them has a length of 10 meters, and calculations 
are performed using a time step of 0.1 seconds. Due to the friction and equal masses, the movement of all objects is  slow. 
In this case, the middle object (M2) swings back and forth because of how the pulley changes direction. At the same time, the bottom object (M3) moves downward 
steadily because of gravity and friction. Even though they all start at the same speed, they move slowly overall. 
Object M1 ends up traveling about 1.6772377372469316 meters away from where it started.


// The main idea of the code implementation was taken from the internet by looking some peoples works in the internet and with some help of ChatGpt,
the main implementation and cases written by me.
